# Custom Linux-Based Network Monitoring and IDS

This repository hosts the source code for a custom-built Network Monitoring and Intrusion Detection System (NIDS), implemented from the ground up on a Linux From Scratch (LFS) platform. Designed with performance and educational value in mind, the project leverages low-level system programming in C/C++, network protocol handling, and data analysis with Python.

## Key Features:

- **Minimalist LFS Base**: A tailored Linux environment built from scratch to run essential networking services with a small footprint.
- **Efficient Packet Sniffing**: Utilizes raw sockets and libpcap in C/C++ for high-performance packet capturing and analysis.
- **Intrusion Detection Algorithms**: Features custom-developed algorithms to detect anomalies and known attack vectors.
- **Automated Alerting**: Implements a Python-based notification system for real-time alerts on potential security incidents.
- **Data Analysis Pipeline**: Incorporates Python scripts for parsing, statistical analysis, and visualization of network traffic data.
- **Web Interface**: Offers a web dashboard for monitoring network health and security alerts using a combination of backend and frontend technologies.

## Project Goals

This project is intended as a comprehensive exercise to showcase system-level programming and network security competencies, as well as to serve as a learning resource for those interested in the inner workings of Linux-based network tools and security systems.
