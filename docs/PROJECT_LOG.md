## Log Entry Template

### Date: [05-11-2023]

**Today's Goals:**
- Preparation, Creating GitHub Repo, 
- Setting up the documents and Downloading the LFS handbook and start reading
- Install Ubuntu server 22.04 on the laptop (Acer Aspire ONE 725 -C62kk  2012/06/21)
 

**Tasks Completed:**
- Set up Github, created doc files
- Installed Ubuntu server as the host system on the laptop
- Tested the version-check.sh script on the local machine (with the packages requirements for the LFS build)

**Problems/Challenges Encountered:**
- Problem 1 - Overwhelming complixity
- ...

**Solutions/Workarounds Implemented:**
- Solution to Problem 1 - Prepare the ground, starting with setting up the version control environment and document everything, AKA using this log
- Download the LFS, and start focusing on that BEFORE even thinking so much about the C/C++ programming part.

**Reflections:**
- Stay focused, small steps at the time. Take time to document and plan.

**Next Steps:**
- Read the LFS handbook
- Configure git and openssh on the laptop
- SCP the version-check.sh to the laptop, check and install missing packages/or update
- Partion the disk and start the LFS build


### Date: [06-11-2023]

**Today's Goals:**
- Configure ssh on the laptop - 192.168.0.40 static IP
- SCP version.check to laptop and get what is required
- Configure the GitHub account on the laptop


**Tasks Completed:**
- Configure ssh on the laptop - 192.168.0.40 static IP
- SCP version.check to laptop and get what is required

**Problems/Challenges Encountered:**
- None, just need to understand all these compiler things better: bison, m4, make etc

**Solutions/Workarounds Implemented:**
- All good, nothing special

**Reflections:**
- Went well, don't have time for git now. Have to go to sleep.

**Next Steps:**
- Set up git on the lap
- Read the LFS handbook
- Partion the disk and start the LFS build

### Date: [07-11-2023]

**Today's Goals:**
- Set up git on the lap

**Tasks Completed:**
- Task finished 

**Problems/Challenges Encountered:**
- The ssh client trying to use PAM but fail

**Solutions/Workarounds Implemented:**
- sudo vim /etc/ssh/ssh_config had to comment out Usepam = no

**Reflections:**
- Not much to day, much that had to be done to day personally.

**Next Steps:**
- Read the LFS handbook
- Partion the disk and start the LFS build
- Start practicing c++ with the C++ book

### Date: [10-11-2023]

**Today's Goals:**
- Create a partition for LFS

**Tasks Completed:**
- Task finished

**Problems/Challenges Encountered:**
- Understanding the filesystem and the different partitions needed is a complex thing. A LVM (Logical Volume Manager) makes this task a little easier since
- I use Ubuntu 22 server as my host system I have this option. This means that I can focus now on the main LFS partitions and then create the extra partitions later if 
- needed, e.g for /tmp or /data etc

**Solutions/Workarounds Implemented:**
- I created a 50 Gb logical volume named lfs from the ubuntu-vg LVM: "sudo lvcreate -L 50G -n lfs ubuntu-vg" then I formatted it as ext4 and mounted it on /mnt/lfs:
- sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/ubuntu-vg/lfs 
mke2fs 1.46.5 (30-Dec-2021)
Creating filesystem with 13107200 4k blocks and 3276800 inodes
Filesystem UUID: 43777f27-5c41-4022-a904-fc4b04e64d9c
Superblock backups stored on blocks: 
	32768, 98304, 163840, 229376, 294912, 819200, 884736, 1605632, 2654208, 
	4096000, 7962624, 11239424

Allocating group tables: done                            
Writing inode tables: done                            
Creating journal (65536 blocks): done
Writing superblocks and filesystem accounting information: done  

- sudo mkdir /mnt/lfs
- sudo mount /dev/ubuntu-vg/lfs /mnt/lfs
- The Ubuntu system is using a large enoug swap file for the LFS to use also: (+NAME):swapon --show    +NAME /swap.img file 3.6G   0B   -2

**Reflections:**
- Not much to day, much that had to be done to day personally.

**Next Steps:**
- Read the LFS handbook
- $LFS variable
- Start practicing c++ with the C++ book

### Date: [11-11-2023]

**Today's Goals:**
- Finish the partition mounting
- env varibles etc
- start installing packages

**Tasks Completed:**
- Partition is correctly mounted
- Env. variable LFS=/mnt/lfs is set for user and root
- Download and make ready for installation the packet list from LFS

**Problems/Challenges Encountered:**
- No issues for now, but will have do fix some pathces when installing

**Solutions/Workarounds Implemented:**
- Nothing special for task 1 and 2
- Downloaded the packet list from LFS with wget and then ran the md5sum - all of them passed
- Changed the owner ship of all the files in $LFS/sources/* to root so that I do not get unnamed UID in the LFS: chown root:root $LFS/sources/*

**Reflections:**
- Still, straight forward to follow the LFS handbook, takes time just because I want to understand what I am doing.

**Next Steps:**
- Read the LFS handbook
- Installing the packets and fix patches where needed
- Start practicing c++ with the C++ book
